# hono-bun-tasks-manager
Hono &amp; Bun Task API This project is a RESTful API for user and task management, built using the Hono framework and the Bun runtime. It is designed to be a lightweight, fast, and modern backend solution with built-in features for validation and authentication. Protected routes.

## Bun Runtime: A blazingly fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## Database: Uses SQLite for data persistence.

## Authentication: Secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## Middleware: Utilizes hono/cors for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing and hono/logger for request logging.

## Input Validation: Enforces request body schemas using Zod and the @hono/zod-validator middleware.

## Task Management: Provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for tasks.

## User Authentication: Includes endpoints for user registration and login.

üì¶ Prerequisites
